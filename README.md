# HillClimbing
solving multi dimentional equation using [Hill Climbing](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwim9_DarvXgAhXBKVAKHUjzD-AQFjACegQIBBAK&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHill_climbing&usg=AOvVaw1tjLtU18WguiDy1Ei0tIC1) algorithm.

Hill Climbing is a heuristic search used for mathematical optimization problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 

## The algorithm step: 
1. Start and initial algorithm with a specific point.
2. Select this point as a solution S.
3. Evaluate this solution.
4. Select a new solution X from the neighborhood of S.
5. Evaluate new solution.
6. if X is better than S -> Select x as new solution and return to level 4. 
7. else X is not better than S -> break algorithm.

# TODO
* Implement the Hill Climbing random start.
* Select next move is random start, too.
